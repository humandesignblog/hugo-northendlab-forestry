My first human design reading!

The reading I had was with Sarah, and the reading was focused on "gates and channels". Most of the reading was looking at the four channels I have in my chart, although we also talked about my Incarnation Cross.

Before I had this reading... I didn't even know that channels are something special in human design! But Sarah explained to me that channels are similar to defined centers: they are fixed energy that is always a part of you. Understanding these channels is thus important for understanding my design. 

## My defined channels

So, I have four channels in my chart. Two of the channels connect my G-center to my Throat center (7-31 and 13-33). One channel connects my Throat center to my Ajna center (62-17). One channel connects my Ajna to my Crown center (24-61). One of my channels is a personality channel, one is a design channel, and two are mixed.

## The 7-31 Channel

This is a leadership channel: mybodygraph calls this "the channel of the Alpha". Here's a quote from Ra about this channel:

> So the 31-7, yes, they do have wonderful skills of leadership. That’s what they’re here for. But the nature of that leadership is that they can never say, “I am the leader. Follow me.” They always have to wait for somebody to say, “You’re the one that can lead us. Will you?” And then they say, “I am the leader. Follow me,” and everybody follows. It’s so simple. And then everybody thinks they’re great leaders.

So yes, being a leader is a huge part of my design (and this is a personality gate, so I am very conscious of it). BUT... it's a leadership that must originate _from the outside._ 

Thinking about it like this really helps me because I have always struggled with people placing me in positions of leadership...but then if I try to _take_ those leadership positions, or lead using my own ideas, I face opposition, blocks, and failure.

So I am made to be a leader, but more like an organizer, a figurehead. I am a person who others place their trust in, and my job is to lead the group based on where they want to be lead and to tune in to their wants.

I mentioned this to Sarah, that I've struggled with this type of leadership. That my idea of a **leader** is almost like a tyrant, a visionary of sorts, and sometimes when I am leading in my way (by listening to what others want and checking in to see that it's democratic), I feel like I am being _too weak_, _not leader-y enough._ But I guess these are just concerns that I will let go, because that's my design.

Gate 7 is my personality Sun, and Gate 31 is my personality South Node, so this gate is a major player in my life. I have line 3 for gate 7 (_the anarchist)_ and line 6 (_application)_ for gate 31, so again this echoes my 3/6 profile of living through trial and error and of being a role model.

In summary, **I have a powerful leadership energy: I am meant to be asked by others to lead, and to lead in a democratic and sensitive way.**

## The 13-33 Channel

This is the "Channel of the Prodigal" and it's about being a natural listener and also about sharing the wisdom found in what I observe.

> The Prodigal is one who goes into the world then returns to his village/tribe and shares the knowledge it found – typically by saying "I remember……..". Every Autobiography and Biography ever written represents this channel. For this channel the experience is less in doing and more in listening to what others have to say - in discovering the secrets of the world and then sharing them.

Sarah explained it like this: I go out into the world, I observe things, I am constantly invited by others into their stories and experiences, and I take this wisdom and store it allll up -- just waiting for someone to ask me for it. I have an incredible amount of wisdom to share, when I am called upon to do so.

Again, this was an energy I am familiar with and which I recognize. All my life, people **crave** my attention, they want to tell their stories and to be heard by me. I've always found if a bit weird, to be honest. It also is true that I store away all information I find, that I love reflecting on it, and that I use what I've observed as a "bank of wisdom" from which I retrieve information. 

This makes sense to me with my Role Model profile also. And these gates are BIG for me: 13 is my Personality Earth and the 33 is my Design South Node. 

My take away: **I am meant to listen, to learn, and to reflect. I am meant to reflect. My reflections have value to others.**

## The 62-17 channel

Venus governs our morals, our values and our beliefs, which in turn govern how we interact with each other and with the world around us. How we express those morals/values/beliefs comes out in how we react to the people in our lives.

Gate 17

This gate holds the energy of ideas and different ways of thinking and doing and being and wants to share these ideas with the world. Remember though, with this being in the ajna it’s gotta be asked for to be well received and heard by those around you or it ends up falling on deaf ears and you end up peeved and feel like no one is listening to you.

Lastly, I just want to say that this can be a super tricky gate because you have all these ideas and want to share them, but timing is everything. And needing to stay in a headspace where you don’t cling too tightly to your opinion and run people into the ground with it. It is a gift to have and hold and you can provide new ways of thinking and doing, just be mindful of your approach that way it’s well received and fully heard.

Gate 62

Gate 62 to me not only works in details and pays attention to every single detail, but also speaks in detail. I’d bet that you’re extremely long winded when trying to explain something. You see where details are missing and want to add them. You have an eye for it and good thing you do because people like me without it need you and I will say conversation is never ever boring when you’re around. I’d imagine you’re either a great storyteller, writer, blogger or work in a career where attention to detail and rearranging and making things look better is your thing.

Gate 17, line 2:

The benefit of associations based on the highest values.

The successful achievement of purpose through proper alignment. The possibility to develop opinions through relationships.

2 Discrimination

04° 48' 45" - 05° 45' 00"

An overactive discrimination that leaves one virtually alone. The possibility of being opinionated at the expense of relationships

Gate 62, line 4

The perfected ascetic withdrawal in the pursuit of harmony and simplicity, where outside dangers do not exist, and there is time to pursue inner meaning in detail.Detail that can only be expressed after periods of isolation and reflection

.**So my summary here is that I am a person with a great deal of opinions AND I know how to express those opinions into words, in great detail and to break it all down. And this is the way in which my beliefs and values are shaped, and this skill of having opinions and breaking them down is closely tied to my beliefs and values systems (Venus).**

I've always seen myself as a super opinionated person and also been aware that nobody wants to hear my opinions. So I guess putting myself in a job where people DO come to me and ask for my opinion is the dream!

## The 24-61 Channel

mercury is communication

saturn: discipline, judgement, discernment: Anywhere Saturn appears in our charts is an indication that through this gate or channel, we're going to be held accountable for the consequences of our actions. Saturn brings an energy of discipline and discernment and begs us to live up to our own values and morals. Just like a judge delivering a sentence, consequences follow when we act outside of our integrity, violating our own moral compass or personal laws.

In your chart, your conscious Mercury provides information about what you need in order to be heard and understood during this incarnation. The unconscious Mercury is a little more tricky, as anything in our unconscious design is so innate that we often don't see it or understand why we're expressing it until it's out there.

24 mercury 3rd line ("the addict" THE NATURAL AND SPONTANEOUS PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION AND RENEWAL.) _going over things again and again and again and again, great detail and understanding_

61 Saturn 5th line (the awareness of universal underlying principles: influence: The enlightened Father figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a generation by its influence) _the MYSTERY, inner knowing, claircognizance_
